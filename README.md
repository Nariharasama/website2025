## Thank you for visiting my GitHub

I'm a web designer, and this is the repository of my homepage. 

## Design

This website is designed in Figma for layout and UI. As I have some expereince on front-end development,
I can consider the design while also pay attention to incoming programing problems.

## Programing and Development

Based on the framework and UI created in Figma, I use next.js(a front-end framework based on React) to 
efficiently create the web application.

## Deploy

The website is deployed using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
